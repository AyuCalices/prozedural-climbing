# Prozedural Climbing

## About the Project
This project was made in Unity using C# for a bachelor's thesis at HTW Berlin, Germany. The thesis is about procedural climbing animations in Unity. This repository represents the prototype of the implemented climbing system on the Unity Version 2021.3.6f1. It implements two different types of climbing.
* Edge Climbing: the character detects edges automatically and climbs between them.
* Free Climbing: the character deteminds hooking points by raycasts to potential new positions and moves towards them.

This repository is archived. Which means, it is read-only. If you want to use the project files in unity, please fork this repository. The release can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/AyuCalices/prozedural-climbing/releases).

## Controls
* W,A,S,D to move around (also during climbing)
* Shift to Sprint
* Space to jump
* Left Mouse Button for a wall run
* Left Mouse Button to start climbing during the wall run or while the character is in the air while a hooking point is in reach
